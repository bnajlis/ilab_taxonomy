      According to British newspaper The Economist, Fernández was considered
      "a president without a plan", and his presidency to be a "weak administration",
      alluding to his lack of independent decision-making. Instead, his decisions
      were under heavy influence of Vice President and former President Cristina
      Fernández de Kirchner, also leader of the coalition, whom Fernández himself
      described as a "permanent source of consultation". In April 2023, Fernández
      announced that he decided to not seek reelection to the presidency in the
      2023 presidential election. He was succeeded by Javier Milei on 10 December 2023.

      was passed by Congress on 23 December. The bill includes tax hikes on foreign currency
      purchases, agricultural exports, wealth, and car sales - as well as tax incentives for
      production. Amid the worst recession in nearly two decades, it provided a 180-day freeze
      on utility rates, bonuses for the nation's retirees and Universal Allocation per Child
      beneficiaries, and food cards to two million of Argentina's poorest families. It also gave
      the president additional powers to renegotiate debt terms – with Argentina seeking to
      restructure its US$100 billion debt with private bondholders and US$45 billion borrowed
      by Macri from the International Monetary Fund. As the capital controls stayed in effect

      standalone market by MSCI.
